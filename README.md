# OpenWeather Application

## About

OpenWeather is an application that provides real-time weather updates for your current location or any city of your choice globally. It leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data, providing information such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and much more.

OpenWeather is built with Kotlin, utilizing modern Android development practices such as Coroutines for asynchronous programming, Jetpack DataStore for data persistence, and Hilt for dependency injection. 

The app follows a clean architecture approach.
